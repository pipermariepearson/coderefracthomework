Assignment summary: Cleaning up a pre-existing html/css website, making the code semantic and accessible. 

My solutions:

I added an alt to each image to increase accessibility. 
I made the alts include language that will increase the website's SEO. 
I created a semantic structure including a <header>, <body>, <footer>, and <aside>
I fixed the "Search Engine Optimization" link by adding an #id to it's tag. 
I couldn't figure out why the body content boxes each had both an id and a class, could not figure out how to consolidate them with out breaking the page.
